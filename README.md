In this project I made a interactive signup page for a simple website. I used the following programming languages:
HTML(Used for the main website build)
CSS(styling the website, making it look good, font size, colours etc.)
JAVASCRIPT(front end, the main areas of focus, like functioning buttons)
I built this on a local host at the moment. It includes, backgrounds, incorrect or correct password, custom backgrounded, hover effet=cts and more
